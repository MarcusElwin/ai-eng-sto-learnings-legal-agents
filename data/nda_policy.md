# NDA POLICY PLAYBOOK

## Introduction

This Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Policy Playbook provides guidance for negotiating and reviewing NDAs. Each section outlines our preferred position, alternative acceptable positions, risk ratings for deviations, and risk descriptions.

## 1. Parties

**Description:** This section identifies who is bound by the NDA. Proper identification of all parties is critical to ensure confidential information is appropriately protected across all relevant entities.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Preferred Position** | All legal entities that will receive confidential information should be explicitly named as parties. Parent companies should be included when subsidiaries are party to the agreement. |
| **Alternative Position** | Subsidiaries may be included through defined terms rather than as direct parties. |
| **Risk Rating** | 游리 Medium |
| **Risk Description** | Failure to include all relevant entities may result in confidential information being shared with organizations not bound by the NDA. |

## 2. Definition of Confidential Information

**Description:** This section defines what information is protected under the NDA. The definition should be sufficiently broad to cover all valuable information while including standard exclusions for information that should not be restricted.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Preferred Position** | Broad definition covering all information disclosed, regardless of marking or designation, with standard carve-outs for public information, independently developed information, and information received from third parties without restriction. |
| **Alternative Position** | Information must be marked as confidential or, if disclosed orally, confirmed in writing within 30 days. |
| **Risk Rating** | 游댮 High |
| **Risk Description** | Narrow definitions may leave valuable information unprotected. The requirement to mark all confidential information creates operational burden and risk of accidental disclosure. |

## 3. Term of Agreement

**Description:** This section specifies how long the NDA remains in effect and how long confidentiality obligations continue after termination. Different types of information may require different protection periods.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Preferred Position** | Initial term of 2-3 years with confidentiality obligations surviving for 5 years after disclosure. |
| **Alternative Position** | Initial term of 1-5 years with confidentiality obligations surviving for 3-7 years after disclosure. |
| **Risk Rating** | 游리 Medium |
| **Risk Description** | Shorter terms may not adequately protect information that remains valuable over time. Perpetual obligations can create compliance burdens. |

## 4. Termination

**Description:** This section outlines how and when parties can end the agreement, including notice requirements and what obligations continue after the agreement ends.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Preferred Position** | Either party may terminate with 30 days written notice. Confidentiality obligations survive termination according to the defined survival period. |
| **Alternative Position** | Either party may terminate with 15-60 days written notice. |
| **Risk Rating** | 游릭 Low |
| **Risk Description** | Shorter notice periods may not provide adequate time to prepare for termination. Lack of survival provisions creates risk of immediate authorized disclosure after termination. |

## 5. Return or Destruction of Information

**Description:** This section addresses what happens to confidential information when the relationship ends. Proper handling of residual information helps prevent unauthorized use or disclosure.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Preferred Position** | Upon termination or request, all confidential information should be returned or destroyed, with certification of destruction if requested. Exception for copies required to be retained for legal/regulatory compliance. |
| **Alternative Position** | Return or destruction with reasonable timeframe (30 days). |
| **Risk Rating** | 游리 Medium |
| **Risk Description** | Failure to recover or ensure destruction of confidential information increases risk of unauthorized use or disclosure after business relationship ends. |

## 6. Non-use of Confidential Information

**Description:** This section restricts how the recipient can use the confidential information. It should clearly limit use to the specific business purpose and prohibit unauthorized analysis or recreation.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Preferred Position** | Recipient may only use confidential information for the specific purpose defined in the agreement. No reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling permitted. |
| **Alternative Position** | Recipient may use confidential information for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship. |
| **Risk Rating** | 游댮 High |
| **Risk Description** | Vague purpose definitions may permit unintended uses of confidential information. Lack of reverse engineering prohibition may allow recipient to extract valuable IP. |

## 7. Personal Data Protection

**Description:** This section addresses how personal data within confidential information should be handled. Specific provisions are necessary to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Preferred Position** | Explicit provisions addressing personal data protection in compliance with applicable laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). No processing of personal data beyond the purpose of the NDA. |
| **Alternative Position** | General reference to compliance with data protection laws. |
| **Risk Rating** | 游댮 High |
| **Risk Description** | Failure to address personal data protection specifically may result in inadequate safeguards for personal information and potential regulatory violations. |

## 8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

**Description:** This section determines which laws apply to the agreement and where disputes will be resolved. Choosing favorable law and jurisdiction can significantly impact enforcement capabilities.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Preferred Position** | California law with exclusive jurisdiction in San Francisco County courts. |
| **Alternative Position** | Law of recipient's primary place of business with non-exclusive jurisdiction. |
| **Risk Rating** | 游리 Medium |
| **Risk Description** | Unfavorable governing law may limit remedies and complicate enforcement. Non-exclusive jurisdiction creates uncertainty regarding dispute resolution venue. |

## 9. Remedies

**Description:** This section outlines the legal remedies available if the agreement is breached. Strong remedy provisions can deter violations and provide more options for enforcement.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Preferred Position** | Acknowledgment that monetary damages may be insufficient; right to seek injunctive relief without proving irreparable harm or posting bond. |
| **Alternative Position** | Standard remedies available at law and equity. |
| **Risk Rating** | 游리 Medium |
| **Risk Description** | Without specific injunctive relief provisions, obtaining emergency court orders to prevent disclosure may be more difficult. |

## 10. Contract Value

**Description:** This section addresses any financial consideration associated with the NDA. Generally, NDAs should not involve payment to avoid tax implications and other complications.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Preferred Position** | No monetary value associated with the NDA itself. |
| **Alternative Position** | Nominal consideration ($1) for enforceability purposes. |
| **Risk Rating** | 游릭 Low |
| **Risk Description** | Assigning monetary value beyond nominal amounts may create tax implications or other financial obligations. |

## Risk Rating Legend

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 游댮 High | Material risk that should be addressed; significant potential for harm if not mitigated |
| 游리 Medium | Moderate risk that should be negotiated if possible, but may be acceptable depending on business context |
